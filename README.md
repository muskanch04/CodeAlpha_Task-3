# üéµ Music Player Web App

This project is a visually rich and fully responsive **Music Player Web Application** built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It mimics the experience of modern music streaming platforms, offering both functionality and style. With a clean cyan background, a purple-accented sidebar, and thoughtfully arranged components, this web app delivers a smooth and immersive experience for users.

Importantly, no external frameworks or libraries have been used‚Äîonly **Lucide icons** (via CDN) for lightweight vector icons and **Google Fonts** for elegant typography. This ensures fast loading, high customizability, and a minimal footprint.
